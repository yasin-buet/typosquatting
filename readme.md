# An Empirical Study on Typosquatting Abuse in Bangladesh 

Typosquatting means the act of purposefully registering a domain name that is a mistype of a popular domain name. Though the concept of typosquatting ages back to 15 years, it is still a new concept in a developing country like Bangladesh, where the Internet users are growing drastically. This paper aims at analysing the typosquatting scenario of popular domains of Bangladesh. Domains are checked if they are live or not after the generation of possible typo domains. Then the potential typo domains are content-analysed to see if they aim at abusing users with spam, scam or any other media. Taking into consideration of the smartness of now-a-days browser, a survey is also done to see the probability that if a user mistypes a domain name the first time, what is the likeliness that s/he types it correct the second time. Proper steps are to be taken at initial stage to cease the misuse of usersâ€™ mistypes.
